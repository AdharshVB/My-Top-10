  <p><em>I watch TV shows to escape From Reality</em></p>
  <hr>
  <p>A television show – or simply TV show – is any content produced for viewing on a television set which can be broadcast via over-the-air, satellite, or cable, excluding breaking news, advertisements, or trailers that are typically placed between
    shows.</p>
  <p>The quality of TV shows is rising very fast. Most new shows have really high-quality production. Plus, they attract and engage a lot of people. Even those who love movies have moved on passing their time by watching TV shows instead.</p>
